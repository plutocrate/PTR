1. Planning & Project Setup

Before touching code, dev teams decide:

Requirements (features, users, constraints)

Tech stack (languages, frameworks, hosting)

Architecture (monolith, microservices, serverless, etc.)

Tools & Skills to know:

Version Control → Git + GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

Project Management → Jira / Trello / Notion / Linear

Design → Figma (UI/UX mockups)

2. Frontend Development

This is the user-facing part — everything running in the browser or on the client.

Core Tech:

Language → JavaScript / TypeScript (TypeScript is industry standard now)

Frameworks:

React (most popular web UI framework)

Next.js (React + SSR/SSG + routing)

Styling:

TailwindCSS (utility-first CSS, very fast to work with)

Component libraries: shadcn/ui, MUI, Chakra UI

State Management:

Zustand, Redux Toolkit, or Jotai for app-wide state

Data fetching:

React Query / TanStack Query (handles caching, loading states)

Forms:

React Hook Form + Zod (validation)

Charts:

Recharts / Chart.js / D3.js

3. Backend Development

This handles data, logic, and APIs.

Core Tech:

Languages → JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js) or Python (FastAPI/Django)

Frameworks:

Express.js (simple, minimal)

NestJS (structured, enterprise-style)

Database:

PostgreSQL (relational) or MongoDB (NoSQL)

ORM (Database Connector):

Prisma (modern ORM for SQL & NoSQL)

Authentication:

NextAuth.js, Clerk, Auth0

APIs:

REST (Express routes)

GraphQL (Apollo Server)

Real-time:

Socket.IO or WebSockets for live data

4. Database & Storage

SQL Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL

NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Firebase Firestore

Cloud DB Hosting:

Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)

PlanetScale (MySQL)

MongoDB Atlas

File Storage:

AWS S3

Supabase Storage

Firebase Storage

5. API Integration

Frontend ↔ Backend communication:

Fetch API / Axios (HTTP requests)

GraphQL for flexible queries

WebSockets for live updates

gRPC for high-performance APIs (less common in small projects)

6. DevOps & CI/CD

Automation for building, testing, and deploying.

Version Control: GitHub/GitLab

CI/CD Platforms:

GitHub Actions (most common)

GitLab CI

CircleCI

Testing:

Unit Testing: Jest, Vitest

Integration Testing: Playwright, Cypress

Linting & Formatting:

ESLint + Prettier

Type Checking:

TypeScript

7. Deployment & Hosting

Frontend Hosting:

Vercel (perfect for Next.js/React)

Netlify

Backend Hosting:

Render

Railway

Fly.io

AWS EC2 / Lightsail

Docker:

Containerization for consistent deployments

Orchestration:

Kubernetes (overkill for small apps, industry standard for large)

8. Real-time Communication

For chat apps, multiplayer tools, live dashboards:

Socket.IO (easy to integrate with Node.js)

WebSockets API (native)

Pusher (managed service)

Firebase Realtime Database

9. Security & Optimization

HTTPS & Certificates:

Let’s Encrypt (free SSL)

Rate limiting:

Express-rate-limit / Nginx config

CORS Handling:

cors package in Express

Data Validation:

Zod / Joi

Password Hashing:

bcrypt

Environment Variables:

dotenv, never hardcode secrets

10. Monitoring & Analytics

Error Tracking:

Sentry

Performance Monitoring:

Lighthouse (Google)

Datadog / New Relic

Analytics:

Google Analytics

PostHog (self-hostable)

### Typical Full Development Cycle

Plan → requirements, design, architecture

Setup → Git repo, CI/CD pipeline

Frontend MVP → basic UI, mock data

Backend MVP → basic API, database

Integration → connect frontend & backend

Authentication & Security

Testing

Deploy to staging

User Testing

Deploy to production

Monitor & maintain
